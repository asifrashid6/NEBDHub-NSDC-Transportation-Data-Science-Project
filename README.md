# NEBDHub-NSDC-Transportation-Data-Science-Project

The TDSP provides an opportunity to gain practical experience with data science by creating data-driven recommendations to make roads safer for all. I learned to assess for potential bias in the data, create pertinent data visualizations, and develop analytical models that can be deployed in the real world. Learners from around the world, from all educational backgrounds and skill levels, are invited to participate. This is an opportunity for you to learn data science techniques in a supportive environment.
