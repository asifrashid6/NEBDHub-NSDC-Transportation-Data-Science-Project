# NEBDHub-NSDC-Transportation-Data-Science-Project

The TDSP provides an opportunity to gain practical experience with data science by creating data-driven recommendations to make roads safer for all. I learned to assess for potential bias in the data, create pertinent data visualizations, and develop analytical models that can be deployed in the real world. 

Milestones:
Data Preparation
Data Ethics, Pre-Processing, and Exploration
Time Series Analysis
Geospatial Analysis
Self-Guided Research Question
Virtual Poster Board Creation: Data Storytelling
